## Adding a custom word breaker in SharePoint 2013
<a name="SP15configsearch_word"> </a>

A custom word breaker can be added to tune word breaking behavior according to your needs. You can use a custom word breaker to replace the existing word breaker of the same language. Alternately, you can use a custom word breaker to replace the existing word breaker with that of a different language. 
  
    
    

## Adding a custom step to modify managed properties in SharePoint 2013
<a name="SP15ConfigSearch_customstep"> </a>

A custom step can be added to modify managed properties in the form of an external content enrichment web service. The content enrichment web service is a service that you can create to receive a callout from the web service client inside the content processing component. A configurable payload is then submitted to the web service, and the response is merged into the crawled item before it is added to the search index.
