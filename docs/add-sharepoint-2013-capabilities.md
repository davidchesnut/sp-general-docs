SharePoint capabilities represent the features that you work with on SharePoint sites, such as workflows, social feeds, and search. By adding SharePoint capabilities to your app, you can help users to do things better and more quickly. 
  
    
    
You can add SharePoint capabilities to whatever kind of app you're developing: SharePoint Add-ins, solutions, sites, components, and mobile apps.
