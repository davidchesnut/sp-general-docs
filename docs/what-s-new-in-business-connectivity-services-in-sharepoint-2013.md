# What's new in Business Connectivity Services in SharePoint 2013
Learn about changes and new features in Business Connectivity Services (BCS) for SharePoint 2013, including enhanced support for REST, OData, external events, and app-scoped external content types. 
Business Connectivity Services (BCS) was introduced in SharePoint 2010 as an improvement to the Business Data Catalog created for Office SharePoint Server 2007.
